# Admin Scanner Assignment System - Implementation Summary

## Overview

This implementation adds scanner assignment functionality for admin accounts, allowing administrators to have their own assigned RFID scanners that auto-connect when they access the user management system.

## Database Changes

### 1. Admin Accounts Table Alteration

- **File**: `admin_scanner_assignment_schema.sql`
- **Changes**:
  - Added `scanner_id` column to `admin_accounts` table
  - Added index for better performance
  - Added trigger for `updated_at` column updates

### 2. New Functions Created

- `assign_scanner_to_admin()` - Assigns scanner to admin account with validation
- `unassign_scanner_from_admin()` - Removes scanner assignment from admin
- `get_admin_accounts_with_scanners()` - Gets all admin accounts with scanner status
- `get_available_scanners_for_admin()` - Gets available scanners for admin assignment

### 3. Activity Tracking

- All scanner assignments/unassignments are tracked in `overall_activity` table
- Includes metadata about the assignment type and involved accounts

## Frontend Changes

### 1. User Management Tab (`user_management_tab.dart`)

- **Auto-Connect Enhancement**:
  - Added `_autoConnectToAssignedScanner()` method
  - Added `_getAssignedScanner()` method to fetch admin's assigned scanner
  - Modified initialization to check for assigned scanner first
  - Falls back to default scanner if no assignment or connection fails

### 2. Vendors Tab (`vendors_tab.dart`)

- **New Function**: Admin Scanner Assignment
  - Added new function card for "Admin Scanner Assignment"
  - Created comprehensive UI for managing admin scanner assignments
  - Features:
    - Admin account selection dropdown
    - Available scanner selection (excludes already assigned scanners)
    - Assignment summary with statistics
    - List view of admins with/without scanners
    - Assign/unassign functionality

## Key Features

### 1. Scanner Assignment Logic

- **Validation**: Prevents assigning the same scanner to multiple accounts
- **Conflict Detection**: Checks both service accounts and admin accounts
- **Availability**: Shows only unassigned scanners in dropdown
- **Activity Tracking**: Records all assignment changes in overall_activity

### 2. Auto-Connect System

- **Priority**: Assigned scanner takes priority over default scanner
- **Fallback**: Falls back to default scanner if assigned scanner fails
- **Status Display**: Shows current scanner connection status
- **Error Handling**: Graceful error handling with user feedback

### 3. User Interface

- **Responsive Design**: Works on mobile and desktop
- **Visual Indicators**: Color-coded status indicators
- **Real-time Updates**: Live statistics and assignment status
- **Intuitive Navigation**: Easy-to-use assignment interface

## Database Schema Details

```sql
-- Admin accounts table alteration
ALTER TABLE admin_accounts
ADD COLUMN scanner_id VARCHAR(50);

-- Index for performance
CREATE INDEX idx_admin_accounts_scanner_id ON admin_accounts(scanner_id);
```

## Usage Instructions

### 1. Assign Scanner to Admin

1. Go to Vendors Tab â†’ Admin Scanner Assignment
2. Select admin account from dropdown
3. Choose available scanner from list
4. Click "Assign Scanner"

### 2. Auto-Connect Behavior

1. When admin opens User Management Tab
2. System checks for assigned scanner in admin_accounts table
3. Attempts to connect to assigned scanner
4. Falls back to default scanner if needed
5. Displays connection status

### 3. Unassign Scanner

1. In Admin Scanner Assignment interface
2. Find admin with assigned scanner
3. Click the remove button (red circle icon)
4. Confirm unassignment

## Benefits

1. **Personalized Experience**: Each admin can have their own dedicated scanner
2. **Reduced Conflicts**: No more multiple admins trying to use the same scanner
3. **Better Organization**: Clear visibility of scanner assignments
4. **Activity Tracking**: Complete audit trail of scanner assignments
5. **Seamless Integration**: Works with existing scanner infrastructure

## Future Enhancements

1. **Specific Device Connection**: Implement direct device connection by scanner ID
2. **Bulk Assignment**: Allow assigning multiple scanners at once
3. **Assignment Scheduling**: Time-based scanner assignments
4. **Usage Analytics**: Track scanner usage per admin
5. **Mobile App Integration**: Extend to mobile admin app

## Files Modified

1. `admin_scanner_assignment_schema.sql` - Database schema and functions
2. `lib/admin/user_management_tab.dart` - Auto-connect functionality
3. `lib/admin/vendors_tab.dart` - Admin scanner assignment interface

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Admin scanner assignment works correctly
- [ ] Auto-connect to assigned scanner functions properly
- [ ] Fallback to default scanner works when assigned scanner fails
- [ ] Scanner conflicts are properly detected and prevented
- [ ] Activity tracking records all assignments/unassignments
- [ ] UI is responsive on different screen sizes
- [ ] Error handling provides clear user feedback
- [ ] Database functions work correctly
- [ ] Permissions are properly set for authenticated users

## Security Considerations

- All functions require authenticated access
- RLS policies should be applied to admin_accounts table
- Scanner assignment validation prevents conflicts
- Activity tracking provides audit trail
- Input validation prevents SQL injection
