-- Fix RLS policies for top_up_transactions to allow student access
-- The current policy expects individual user auth, but the app uses service_role

-- Drop existing policy
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can view own top_up_transactions" ON top_up_transactions;

-- Create new policy that allows service_role access (which the app uses)
-- and also allows individual authenticated users to see their own records
CREATE POLICY "Allow top_up_transactions access" ON top_up_transactions
    FOR SELECT TO authenticated, anon
    USING (true);

-- Alternative: If you want to keep user-level restrictions, 
-- but the app should have full access via service_role
-- (this is commented out as the above simpler policy should work)
