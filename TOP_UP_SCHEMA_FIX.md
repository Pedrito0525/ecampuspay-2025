# Top-Up Schema Fix - auth_user_id Issue

## Problem

The top-up transactions schema was referencing `auth_user_id` in the `admin_accounts` table, but this column doesn't exist in the consolidated database schema.

## Root Cause

The `admin_accounts` table in the consolidated schema doesn't have an `auth_user_id` column because admin accounts are separate from the Supabase auth system.

## Fix Applied

1. **Removed Invalid RLS Policy**: Removed the admin RLS policy that referenced non-existent `auth_user_id` column
2. **Simplified Access Control**: Admin access is handled through `service_role` permissions, not RLS policies
3. **Maintained Student Security**: Students can still only see their own transactions through RLS

## Updated RLS Policies

### Before (Broken):

```sql
CREATE POLICY "Admin can view all top_up_transactions" ON top_up_transactions
    FOR SELECT TO authenticated
    USING (
        EXISTS (
            SELECT 1 FROM admin_accounts
            WHERE auth_user_id = auth.uid()  -- ‚ùå This column doesn't exist
            AND is_active = true
        )
    );
```

### After (Fixed):

```sql
-- Note: Admin access is handled through service_role, not through RLS policies
-- since admin accounts are separate from Supabase auth system
```

## How It Works Now

1. **Admin Access**: Uses `SupabaseService.adminClient` which has `service_role` permissions
2. **Student Access**: Uses `SupabaseService.client` which respects RLS policies
3. **Security**: Students can only see their own transactions via RLS policy

## Testing

Run the test script to verify everything works:

```sql
\i test_topup_schema.sql
```

## Files Modified

- `top_up_transactions_schema.sql` - Fixed RLS policies
- `test_topup_schema.sql` - Added test script

## Verification Steps

1. Execute the updated schema
2. Run the test script
3. Test admin top-up functionality
4. Test student transaction history
5. Verify RLS is working correctly

The system should now work without the `auth_user_id` error.
